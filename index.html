            (Spanish pronunciation: [riˈkaɾðo aɾˈxona]), is a Guatemalan singer-songwriter.</br>

            with more than 80 million records sold.[1] He is often called El Animal Nocturno </br>
            (The Nocturnal Animal),[2] thanks to his breakthrough success with his fourth studio album,</br> 
            which bears the same name. His music ranges from ballads to Latin pop, rock, pop rock, Cuban </br>
            music, and more recently a cappella performances and a mixture of Tejano music and Norteño music, </br>
            and other Afro-American and Latin sounds. Arjona is noted for his lyrical style, and often addresses </br>
            topics such as love, sexuality, violence, racism and immigration.</br>
