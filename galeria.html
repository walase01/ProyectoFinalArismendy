        The series focuses on Asta, a young orphan who was raised from birth after being abandoned</br>
        at the doorstep of an orphanage in Hage village along with his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone
        is born with the ability to utilize Mana in the form of Magical Power (魔力, Maryoku), Asta is the only 
        exception. He tries to gain magical power through physical training. Conversely, Yuno was born as a prodigy 
        with immense magical power and the talent to control wind magic. Motivated by a desire to become the next 
        Wizard King, an authority figure second to the king of Clover Kingdom, the two youths developed a friendly 
        rivalry. Yuno obtains a legendary four-leaf grimoire held by the kingdom's first Wizard King. Asta, despite 
        his lack of magic, obtained the mysterious five-leaf grimoire (which cannot be clearly identified by others 
        since it is worn out), which contains mysterious elf swords and rare anti-magic. Afterward, he and Yuno</br> 
        each join a Magic Knight squad as the first step to fulfill their ambitions. Throughout the story Asta and</br> 
        Yuno embark on various adventures, as they make a name for themselves throughout the Clover Kingdom. Both</br> 
        characters strive to one day hold the title of Wizard King.</br>
